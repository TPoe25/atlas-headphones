# Atlas Headphones Project

## Project Overview

In this project, we will build a fully functional web page from scratch based on a design provided by Nicolas Philippot, a UI/UX designer. The objective is to create a web page that matches the designer's file as closely as possible, utilizing HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design techniques.

## Concepts

For this project, we implemented a design from scratch without using any library. We applied all HTML, CSS, Accessibility, and Responsive Design knowledge we have learned previously.

## Our Objective

Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer's file.

## Requirements
- No external CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap)
- No JavaScript usage

## Tasks

  **Interactions note:**
  - The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
  - Links hover/active: `#FF6565`
  - Button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`
  - Max width of the content: 1000px centered on the page.
